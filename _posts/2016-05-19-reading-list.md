excerpt: want to be a manager? **people, people, people**; also, why it's crucial to only hire and **then trust those people to do their best work** -- *or fire them*

[Julie Zhuo's Medium](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/unintuitive-things-i-ve-learned-about-management-f2c42d68604b) offers new managers some insightful advice from her last seven years in the tech business. While it's an uncomfortable fact to software engineers who expect success to be == a passing unit test, management is a "certain kind of black art with no hard and fast rules." It can take a long time for the unit test of management to turn green, but a manager's success "eventually emerges *clear as daylight*."

* **People, people, people**. "Imagine you spend a full day in back-to-back 1:1s talking to people. Does that sound awful or awesome?" If not, you might want to stick to tech.
* You **don't need all the answers**, your team does. Eventually, anyway -- your job is to help them find their own answers
* The strength of the manager **shows itself in the strength of the team**. As a manager, it doesn't matter much what *you* accomplish individually each day, but it does matter what your team accomplishes.

One of the best parts of Julie's Medium is that it's just part 1. Stay tuned for more.

Laura Roeder ([@lkr](https://twitter.com/lkr)) emphatically exposes why it's so, so, so, so, so very important that you give your people (even remote people) your full trust on day one. It works brilliantly because **you've only hired people who care deeply about doing their best work for you, haven't you**? *Haven't you?* If you haven't, and/or you don't trust your people, it's very likely time to part ways.
