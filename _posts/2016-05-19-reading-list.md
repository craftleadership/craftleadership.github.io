excerpt: want to be a manager? **people, people, people**
---

[Julie Zhuo's Medium](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/unintuitive-things-i-ve-learned-about-management-f2c42d68604b) offers new managers some insightful advice from her last seven years in the tech business. While it's an uncomfortable fact to software engineers who expect success to be == a passing unit test, management is a "certain kind of black art with no hard and fast rules." It can take a long time for the unit test of management to turn green, but a manager's success "eventually emerges *clear as daylight*."

* **People, people, people**. "Imagine you spend a full day in back-to-back 1:1s talking to people. Does that sound awful or awesome?" If not, you might want to stick to tech.
* You **don't need all the answers**, your team does. Eventually, anyway -- your job is to help them find their own answers
* The strength of the manager **shows itself in the strength of the team**. As a manager, it doesn't matter much what *you* accomplish individually each day, but it does matter what your team accomplishes.

One of the best parts of Julie's Medium is that it's just part 1. Stay tuned for more.
