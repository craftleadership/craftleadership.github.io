excerpt: "**We are defined by what we build.** Articulating a clear, bold vision matters as much today as it did when we built the Brooklyn Bridge"
---

First, Rands did it again. If you don't know, you should know: **Michael Lopp** is [Rands in Repose](http://randsinrepose.com/), writer of a number of things including *[Managing Humans](http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1430243147)* and a great commentator on software engineering leadership.

Yesterday he wrote about the Brooklyn Bridge as a "defiant end result of how [the greatest] engineering stories begin." The visionary, Roebling (and later his son), who likely fought off the naysayers and the entrenched water taxi lobby to build what seemed like the impossible with no power tools, no diving gear, grit, and only a few years after the civil war.

Rands reminds engineers that we (as both engineers and as a culture)

>are defined by what we build. It’s not just the engineering ambition that designed these structures, nor the 20 people who died building the Brooklyn Bridge. It’s that we believe we can and decide to act.

Around the time that Rands published this, journalist Varun Sood wrote an interesting piece about the very different experiences of the first 100 days of two huge tech CEO's -- Infosys and Wipro. (The two consulting firms employ about half a million people combined.)

The Infosys CEO's "clear vision and ability to articulate it helped Infosys shares jump 24% in the 100 days." By contrast, Wipro's chief's refusal or lack of ability to articulate a clear vision to investors means the company's stock has dropped 5% in his first 100 days.

Articulating a clear, bold vision matters as much today as it did then.
