excerpt: Solid advice for coaching your engineers as they face the mental demons standing between them and their code
---

[SE Daily](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/) turned me on to a wonderful little article from Tomek Rusilko ([@rusilko](https://twitter.com/rusilko)) at [Lunar Logic](http://www.lunarlogic.io/) - a boutique dev shop out of Krakow - to help engineers deal with the daily mental demons we all face and that can crush our ability to contribute. As a leader of the craft, it's ***awesome advice to always keep in your back pocket when you need to coach the team***:

* The Wall - when you're feeling stuck, focus on getting a small task started - anything to keep moving. It works.
* The Shame - don't sweat some crappy code whenever you're starting something new, *we are not our code* and it's fixable
* The Impostor - remember we suffer from some degree of impostor syndrome and "It’s not who you are that holds you back. It’s who you think you’re not." (Denis Waitley)
* The Expert - want to be an expert? It means you need to fail **a lot**
* The Perfectionist - don't sweat perfection, there's no such thing
* The Hermit - don't try to be that person; writing code professionally means being social
