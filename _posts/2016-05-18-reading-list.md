excerpt: Solid advice for coaching your engineers as they face the mental demons standing between them and their code; code reviews as cultural bionic hammers, or why and how pre-commit code reviews matter to your culture
---

[SE Daily](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/) turned me on to a wonderful little article from Tomek Rusilko ([@rusilko](https://twitter.com/rusilko)) at [Lunar Logic](http://www.lunarlogic.io/) - a boutique dev shop out of Krakow - to help engineers deal with the daily mental demons we all face and that can crush our ability to contribute. As a leader of the craft, it's ***awesome advice to always keep in your back pocket when you need to coach the team***:

* The Wall - when you're feeling stuck, focus on getting a small task started - anything to keep moving. It works.
* The Shame - don't sweat some crappy code whenever you're starting something new, *we are not our code* and it's fixable
* The Impostor - remember we suffer from some degree of impostor syndrome and "It’s not who you are that holds you back. It’s who you think you’re not." (Denis Waitley)
* The Expert - want to be an expert? It means you need to fail **a lot**
* The Perfectionist - don't sweat perfection, there's no such thing
* The Hermit - don't try to be that person; writing code professionally means being social

On the [FullStory Blog](http://blog.fullstory.com), software engineer Bruce tells us not only why **pre-commit** code reviews are important but also how to do it with git feature branches. If you're reading this, you're probably already sold on why code reviews are such a critical part of your development workflow.

What's possibly more important to the craft and why it's so important for us as leaders are the intangibles, such as:

* Code reviews are a "bionic cultural hammer" - intriguing, huh? Read the article for what Bruce is talking about.
* Code reviews promote openness
* Code reviews raise team standards
* Code reviews propel teamwork
* Code reviews keep security top of mind
* Code reviews frame social recognition

In short, code reviews help the engineers "rehearse cultural priorities" which leads to "the cultural ingredients of quality code, happier colleagues, and a better experience for our customers."
