excerpt: Some indicia to indicate that you're ready for true leadership
---

I don't know about you, but I usually shy away from the spammy-looking LinkedIn posts. But this one seemed unique and worth a few minutes of your time.

According to this article, these are some signs that you're ready for true leadership:

* **You have matured enough to think beyond yourself**. "No longer do you only think about yourself and satisfying your personal needs or desires."

* **Work doesnâ€™t feel like work anymore**. You're not backing your car into the parking lot anymore so you can bolt out of there at 4:59 p.m. Now your "passion and enjoyment for the work you are doing is contagious and others can count on you because of your work ethic and positivity."

* **You can handle criticism gracefully**. " No longer is your first reaction to get defensive or stop listening." Now you crave feedback because it leads directly to your improvement.

* **You spend time studying leadership instead of studying Netflix**. "You choose reading books and listening to podcasts regularly over watching TV from 8PM-11PM (except on Game of Thrones night of course)."
