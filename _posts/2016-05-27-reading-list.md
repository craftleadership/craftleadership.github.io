* Mamie Kanfer Stewart ([@mamieks](https://twitter.com/mamieks)) says the "best one-on-one meetings **center around the growth of the employee, not the completion of their tasks**." In your 1:1s, you should be providing guidance, removing roadblocks, setting goals, and building relationships.

* An [Impraise](http://www.impraise.com/) blog has **an awesome list of 1:1 questions and topics** organized under these headings: employee's work habits, team collaboration/relationships, team happiness, short-term goals, personal development, and your improvement areas as a manager.

* [Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/) -- never overlook Michael Lopp's advice that your job as a manager in "**a 1:1 is to give [even] the smallest voice a chance to be heard**" from the noise of the loud mouths running around the office. He proposes three possible ways a 1:1 may go: a status update, a vent, or (steel yourself) a disaster. *It's a must read for engineering managers.* [The Update, The Vent, and The Disaster](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/)

* Some more **great 1:1** questions and guidance from Ben Horowitz (from [Andreessen Horowitz](http://a16z.com/)) in his blog: [One on One](http://www.bhorowitz.com/one_on_one).

* O'Reilly has a link-rich post on doing one on ones. After reading all the items on my list, the substance might feel a little light, but I'm including it because it's a good overview. And all those links will give you even more to read and dovetail into! [How to do a one-on-one that really counts](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2014/09/30/30-minutes-one-on-one/)
