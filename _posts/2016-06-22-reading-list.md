excerpt: Some ideas on how to move from up to senior leadership
---

If you're reading Craft + Leadership (and you ***should*** be), you're probably already in a leadership position. So a question you may have is: "*How do I move into a senior leadership position?*" A recent *Forbes* post has some ideas:

* **Do strategy**: It's not just for Ivy league MBA's and McKinsey alums. "Next-level leaders are proactive about generating ideas about how their wider team or organization could drive new growth, taking responsibility beyond their immediate sphere of accountability."

* **Be a thought leader**: Being a thought leader in your organization means "thinking beyond your immediate borders." While busy managers feel they don't have the time or resources to think beyond the needs of their teams or immediate groups, doing so "should be a central part of our role" as professionals.

* **Have a few elevator pitches ready**: You never know when you're going to run into a Big Cheese in the elevator and want to demonstrate all the value you're adding to the firm. Don't fake it; state it.

* **Commit**: Moving up in the company means you understand where your industry is going and where your firm plays a part, which implies you're spending some of your free time keeping up with the industry doesn't it?
