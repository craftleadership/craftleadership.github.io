excerpt: We might a **bias blind spot** if we believe that only people who actively participate in open source after hours "are passionate and/or good developers"

[Belen Albeza ](http://www.belenalbeza.com/) ([@ladybenko](https://twitter.com/ladybenko))  suggests that we have a bias or least a blind spot to a bias when we, as leaders, assume that top developers have to exhibit their passion for software engineering by their outside activities:

>Neglecting candidates for a position because they don't contribute to open-source projects; choosing who to fire on the basis of who has a pet project and who doesn't; expecting employees to keep up with new technologies, frameworks and languages entirely on their own; etc.

Among many problems, she cautions that **only "a very specific demographic can afford to" be spending a lot of time after work** on open source projects, learning technologies and techniques, and etc.

I've been biased to this myself, which is hypocritical considering that I have precious little time outside of work (given that I have kids and a life) to make the same kinds of outside-of-work investments that I've come to seek in top engineers.

*Something to think about.*
