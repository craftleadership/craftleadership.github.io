excerpt: Asana shares its engineering values to show how to make software engineering more effective
---

The engineers at [Asana](https://asana.com/) wrote up a monster post that includes many different engineering voices from their team.

In summary, their values can be summarized as:

>Not sure where to start? **Learn with curiosity**. Struggling to get it all right? **Strive for simplicity**. Want to move forward? **Articulate your mental model**. Not sure how to lead? **Teach with compassion**. Trying to win the marathon? **Ship fast, sustainably**. Need to inspire others? **Fix problems, even when they’re not yours**.

The post goes on to elaborate on the details -- pretty interesting.

Of interest to leaders (readers of this site), they say leadership == teaching with compassion. By that, Asana engineering manager Marco Gallotta says:

>Teaching with compassion means sharing your knowledge and realizing the leverage of empowering your teammates. It’s not making someone feel inferior for not knowing what you know, it’s **giving them the patience they need to make progress**. To do this, we strive to understand from the learner’s perspective.

Emphasis was mine because I think that's what he means by "leader as teacher."
