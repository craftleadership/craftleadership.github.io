No reading list for today, but tomorrow should be an interesting craftsmanship roundtable discussion with 20 or 30 of LA's Westside's craftsmanpeople.

If you're in the neighborhood, join us at [Event Farm](https://www.eventfarm.com/): [Craftsmanship Roundtable - Clean Coding, TDD, Software Engineering, and More](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Software-Craftsmanship/events/231124612/)!
