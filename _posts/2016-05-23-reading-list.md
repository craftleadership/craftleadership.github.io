excerpt: How to hire an engineering manager, or put differently, how to hire a unicorn
---

Writing for O'Reilly, Camille Fournier ([@skamille](https://twitter.com/skamille)) warns that most organizations are going to fail at hiring engineering managers because in too many cases they're looking to **hire unicorns**. But there *are* tactics and opportunities to get it right:

First, consider **hiring for potential**: since it's usually better to grow management from within, think about a candidate senior engineer's management capabilities as they come in the door. Read Fournier's article for details, but she's got some specific advice about what to probe for. Generally, you're looking for a senior engineer's focus on others' successes rather than their own (*that's leadership, is it not?*).

If you don't have the potential or in-house pipeline, you might need to **hire for experience** (i.e., hire an experienced manager from the outside). Fournier suggests a few interview questions to make dangerous landscape as successful as possible:

* Probe to get a sense of how committed the candidate is to bring in their own talent. "The best managers are capable of bringing in their own candidates, even at big companies."
* Ask them how they spend their day. "If you expect someone who will be very hands-on and the candidate is used to spending all day in meetings, it may not work out well."
* Ask them what a manager is. I **love** this question, and Fournier says that if you're good then you're going to have a point of view here. Management is a "critical position of influence, and you want someone who has an idea of what it means to be great in the role."
