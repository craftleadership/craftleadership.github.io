excerpt: Transparency in the hiring process may bring **great engineers out of the shadows** for the engineering team at Slack.
---

A few days ago, Slack engineering director **Julia Grace** ([@jewlia](https://twitter.com/jewelia)) published a post on the step-by-step process engineers can expect when applying to and interviewing at Slack.

Their process is straightforward-seeming at a high level:

1. resume screen
2. 30 min phone tech screen
3. technical exercise
4. onsite interview

What's less than obvious from the process is the team's emphasis on (a) **reducing bias** and (b) focusing on the kind of **day to day work that engineers actually do** instead of spot, artificial coding interviews. Put differently, Slack seems to work hard to minimize the artificial effects of interview pressure and the skewed results created thereby.

Also interesting is that Grace's post highlights some of the current technical challenges facing Slack in their stack. This seems particularly valuable to me because it **seems calculated to drawing out bright engineers from the shadows** who might say, "hey I can help the Slack engineers with that problem" when they might not have even considered applying previously.
