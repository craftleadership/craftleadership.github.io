excerpt: The Geeky Leader draws an important distinction between leading on principles and leading on organizational/political know-how
---

[Tomas Kucera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomaskucera), the [Geeky Leader](https://thegeekyleader.com/), writes from time to time on leading software engineers. Yesterday, he posted something fresh that I haven't seen before.

There's a lot in his post, but my big takeaway is this: in an organization, there are people who are really good at a technical task (say, making a truly awesome algorithm), and there are also people who are really good navigating the enterprise landscape to get stuff done (say, greasing the QA wheels to get code into production).

To Kucera, it seems that **knowing how to navigate the enterprise maze proves only mastery of the maze -- not mastery of enterprise evolution**. *Makes sense, right?*

So it's incumbent upon us leaders to not get lost in the political maze or focus our leadership on navigation of the maze; it's our duty to evolve our people and our organizations to principles that truly matter.
