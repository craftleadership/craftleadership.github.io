### That article circulating the internets
Bill Jordan hit publish on a Medium post a few days ago, and it's been circulating LinkedIn and Twitter quite a bit lately (it's even trending on Pocket -- not bad for a one time writer). Bill's a software development director (director in the sense that he manages managers) deep in the Lone Star State (e.g., Austin). He's got some sage and some controversial ideas for your consideration:

* ***Be wary who you think your "high" performers are***. It's all too possible that you think of your high performers as engineers who "get work done quickly." Unfortunately, it's all too likely you're confusing impression with reality. More likely, they are "achieving what appears to be high levels of productivity by building **technical debt**." True high performers are actually very rare, says Bill, so consider what you're valuing

* Most importantly to me, ***encourage continual product improvement***. Bill's advice succinctly captures what I'm trying to do with craftsmanship in the enterprise--

>Developers that become accustomed to doing continual improvement tend to be happier developers because continual improvement gives them autonomy and a strong sense of making valuable contributions on their own terms. **Donâ€™t underestimate the morale boost.**

Of course, he cautions that senior leadership "will need to recognize that things will take more time since developers will be working on their primary project while simultaneously making incremental improvements." *But that morale boost makes it worthwhile on multiple dimensions.*

* Controversially, consider ***encouraging code ownership among engineers***. The writer argues it makes sense to parcel out modules of the code base to engineers. Those engineers then have full stewardship of those modules, which means that nobody other engineer can change the code without the owner's consent. This advice seems controversial to me, but Bill offers some reasons why that you should read; I'll leave it to you to make your own judgment. I'm still unconvinced.

* ***No open workspaces***. This advice is also controversial to many, but less to me. I think most engineers are either introverted and/or simply need quiet space to work (and headphones don't cut it). That said, I've seen some workspaces set up with engineering "neighborhoods" that combine open and closed environments, which seem like a pretty good compromise to me -- as long as the team or management encourages a balance. As a corollary, Bill also suggests ***limiting interruptions*** including drive-bys, IMs, and Slack mentions.

* ***Nuture your leaders***. You'll know them when they own the white board, I always say. *Spend extra energy on these people*.

* ***Be wary of metrics***. Software engineers are not only highly intelligent, they're generally pretty clever. They will game your metrics, especially if the metrics impact their organizational reputation, are highly visible, and/or are widely reported.

### Second, resumes are broken, or why and how to hire without resumes

Everyone knows the whole resume thing is suboptimal, tedious, lame, broken. It's garbage in, garbage out. We've tried to solve it with computers, but it feels like applicant tracking systems (ATSs) select in the wrong candidates as often they select out the right candidates (or, select out too often, depending on your P.O.V.). Human filters exhibit different biases but surely don't perform much better than their algorithmic counterparts. ***Resumes are broken.*** I'm surely not the first to say so.

So if resumes are broken, *what if we just got rid of resumes?*

It may be an anecdotal data point, but Pure Storage did just that. Instead of submitting resumes, candidates can just do a coding challenge. It's not clear whether the technique is giving the company a strong enough hiring pipeline, but they featured one highly successful candidate who almost surely would have failed the resume roullette challenge -- an employee who's apparently done wonderfully for the company.

It's an interesting thought worth considering. Of course, Pure Storage's reported experience raises more questions than it answers for me. Besides the pipeline issue, there's *a lot* more to hiring an engineer into a team than the candidate's raw processing horsepower. So how does Pure Storage handle the behavioral factors? Do they use the quiz to trigger a behavioral phone screen that may then lead to an onsite? Or just jump to an onsite for the best performers?

Whatever the pipeline or actual rituals at Pure Storage, optimizing for something other than resumes is an approach to take seriously.

(Also, take the post with a grain of salt... after I wrote this post I realized that it came from HackerRank's blog, which is obviously interested in promoting test-based applicant screening.)
