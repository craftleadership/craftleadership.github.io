There's a Medium post circulating LinkedIn and Twitter from a director of engineering (director in the sense that he manages development managers) from somewhere deep in the Lone Star State. He's got both sage and controversial ideas for your consideration:

* ***Be wary of your "high" performers*** These are the engineers who appear to "get work done quickly" but you're probably confusing the reality with the impression. More likely, they are simply "achieving what appears to be high levels of productivity by building technical debt." True high performers are actually very rare, says Bill.

* My favorite is to ***encourage continual product improvement***. Bill's advice succinctly captures what I'm trying to do with craftsmanship in the enterprise--

>Developers that become accustomed to doing continual improvement tend to be happier developers because continual improvement gives them autonomy and a strong sense of making valuable contributions on their own terms. Donâ€™t underestimate the morale boost.

Of course, he cautions that "management will need to recognize that things will take more time since developers will be working on their primary project while simultaneously making incremental improvements." *But that morale boost makes it worthwhile.*

* Consider ***encouraging code ownership***. The writer argues is makes sense to parcel out modules of an application's code and assign full stewardship of those modules. In this model, nobody other engineer would be able modify the module's code without the owner's consent. This advice seems controversial to me. I'll leave it to you to make your own judgment.

* ***No open workspaces***. This advice is also controversial, but I'm inclined to agree. I think most engineers need quiet space to work (and headphones don't cut it). That said, I've seen some engineering "neighborhoods" that combine open and closed environments, which seems very good to me. As a corollary, he also suggests ***limiting interruptions*** including drive-bys.

* ***Nuture your leaders***. You'll know them when they own the white board, I always say.

* ***Be wary of metrics***. Software engineers are not only highly intelligent, but they're generally pretty clever. They will game your metrics, especially if the metrics are highly visible and widely reported.

* ***
