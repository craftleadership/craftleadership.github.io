It's about 9:00 p.m. West Coast time on Friday as I write today's reading list. *So let's not read anything.* Let's just watch. In fact, you're probably not going to see this until Monday morning. So let's make this some Monday inspiration for you.

First, let's go back to **Amy Cuddy**'s TED talk from 2012. Most of the people reading Craft + Leadership are first time managers. If you're like me, you felt like an impostor. Even if you're one of the 34 million people who've seen it before, it might help to watch it again.

* The leader in the room has a different hormonal cocktail going on than you do. If you're not the alpha, there's an easy way to fix that.

* And if you fix it, you can **finally find true presence in the room**.

* And that will make all the difference.

Near the end of Amy's talk, she notes that small tweaks make a big difference. I remembered Tony Robbins made the same point, even if he intuited his way to the same conclusion. Tony Robbins is not the usual engineering fare, I get it, but spend 8 minutes to watch this one.

**"When all hell's breaking loose and nothing's working, remember you're only one or two millimeters off."** So don't give up. One tiny change can change everything a day, a week, a month, a year from now.

Sounds a lot like what Cuddy's got, huh? I'm not sure I'm ready to go where Tony goes on this talk, but it's entertaining -- and motivating, of course. It's Tony Robbins.
