Just a quick, fun one for the weekend: [leadership lessons from a dancing guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ). It's a video of a guy dancing alone, like a fool in front of everyone as [Sasquatch](https://www.sasquatchfestival.com/), **foolish like I feel fairly often** in front of whatever meeting or community I'm trying to pull together. Then another guy joins. Then a third. Then the tipping point, and it's a huge crowd. It all happens in just three minutes, and it's pretty amazing.

It's an old video from 2010, so maybe you saw it years ago. I'm not even sure if my link is the original source, if it's actually legit, or if I even agree with all the advice, but **it sure is fun to watch**.
